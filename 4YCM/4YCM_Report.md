## Fourth Year Committee Report

Meeting: October 27th, 2015 in MSB 6503  

### Research Progress
The manuscript I submitted last year has been published in ISMEJ.  This work shows evidence for both of the two major models of bacterial speciation by tracking single-nucleotide variants in populations of bacteria using 30 Metagenome-assembled (reference) genomes (MAGs) and a metagenomic timeseries containing 63 samples over 6 years.
We found that one population showed a genome-wide loss of diversity where others had seen a reduction in diversity for only a particular region of the genome.
This suggests that co-existing populations in the lake have a high selection to recombination ratio where others have a low selection to recombination ratio.  

In the past year, I've also worked on the population dynamics of many dominant freshwater bacteria, focusing on two groups (which represent roughly family level) for which we have multiple single-amplified genomes (SAGs) and sequence-discrete populations.
Genetically distinct populations within tribes (roughly analogous to species level) of the acI actinobacterial lineage living in the same lake had different seasonal abundance patterns, suggesting these populations were also ecologically distinct.
In contrast, sympatric LD12 populations were much less genetically differentiated and had similar temporal abundance patterns. This suggests that within one lake, some freshwater lineages harbor genetically discrete (but still closely related) and ecologically distinct populations, while other lineages are composed of less differentiated populations with overlapping niches.
I have submitted the manuscript for this project on bioRxiv, a biology preprint server and it will soon be submitted to Nature Communications.  

The manuscripts for both of these projects are attached to this report.


#### New Questions
I continue to be interested in discerning the forces shaping wild bacterial populations and would like to turn my focus from the whole genomes of populations to their gene content.

*Does selection effect homologs of the same gene differently?  What traits are under strong selection?*  First I will identify the homologous genes in the reference MAGs and SAGs using BLAST and clustering.  Then I will mapping the metagenomic reads from the same lake back the reference genomes to find SOMETHING the sequence-discrete populations.  For each of these populations and their genes, I will calculate the relative abundance, call single nucleotide variants, and calculate the selection. <!-- FINISH THIS -->

*Are there related sequence-discrete populations in TB and CB?  How closely related are they?  Do they share a common gene pool?* We now have MAG's from Crystal Bog (CB), which is of similar location and trophic status to Trout Bog (TB).  With these genomes, I will ask if there are related populations and how similar they are at the genome scale.  I will also investigate if these populations are really separated or if they share a common genepool.  I will compare the reference genomes and map reads from the opposite source.  From the acI SAGs we saw that reference genomes collected from different lakes do not recruit metagenomic reads with high ANI.
