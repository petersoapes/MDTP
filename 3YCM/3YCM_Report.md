## Research Progress
Over the past year I have worked on tracking a set of thirty sequence-discrete populations from Trout Bog, as they are represented by genomes assembled from metagenomes(GFMs), using 63 metagenomes from 6 of years. I called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and looked for genes gained or lost by the populations.  One genome showed a genome-wide sweep of diversity through the time series.  Other genomes show evidence of past gene-sweeps, regions of statistically significant low diversity.  From these results, we have propose that diversity within different co-occuring populations may be controlled by different mechanisms(recombintaiton vs. selection).  I currently have a manuscript submitted to ISMEJ on the results of this analysis.  

I am also currently working on a manuscript concerning the population dynamics of the ubiquitous and abundant freshwater bacterium acI.  We have 14 single cell genomes(SAGs) from this clade, representing four lakes and five tribes.  We mapped reads from the Lake Mendota time series as 5 of the SAGs are from Lake Mendota.  In order to understand how these SAGs would map to one another, we shredded the genomes and mapped them against each other.  We found that SAGs from different tribes do not map well to each other.  In fact, even SAGs from the SAME tribe don't always map well to each other.  When we mapped reads from Lake Mendota to the SAGs, we found that SAGs from collected from different lakes showed a different distribution of identity among the hits.  This isn't surprising as the population represented by the SAG has diverged from the allopatric population present in Lake Mendota.   <!--- Something about the gene patterns through time and coverage differences -->  

### New Questions
*Are there related sequence-discrete populations in TB and CB?  How closely related are they?  Do they share a common gene pool?* We now have GFM's from Crystal Bog, which is of similar location and trophic status to Trout Bog.  With these genomes, I will see if there are related populations and how similar they are.  I will also investigate if these populations are really separated or if they share a common genepool.  I will compare the reference genomes and map reads from the opposite source.  From the acI SAGs we can see that reference genomes collected from different lakes do not map with high ANI.

*Are all populations sequence-discrete?  What do non-seq-discrete groups look like? How does ANI structure of sequence-discrete populations compare between different lineages?* Most of the populations we have studied must be sequence-discrete in order to assemble into reference genomes from metagenomes.  One of my next goals is to investigate and compare population structures using references not assembled from communities.  Using both our single cell genomes, in conjunction with our metagenomes, and other marine datasets of metagenomes paired with single cell and sequenced fosmids, I will investigate population structure.  I am interested to see if I can find a population which does not fit the sequence-discrete pattern.  I have found some preliminary evidence that LD12 and acTH1 have different structures.  Along the same lines, I would like to quantify how the population structure, using ANI, is different for different lineages.
