### Research Progress

(specific new findings)
-MSM, LEWES
-CO : SC ratio (Gough looks different than the others)

I have been quantifying sex specific recombination rates in house mice strains.  
(since prelimB) Over the past year...
shifted focus on phylogenic comparative methods to (discriptive method of variation of recombination rates).
utilize 

 1. I have heterochiasmy measures of 5 strains....
new strains, MSM (molossinus), very high and male direction of heterochiasmy.
LEWES - 

 1. I have arranged to get more mouse strains samples -- increase the number of evolutionary levels
BRC RIKEN Japan -- 3 wild derived Mmmusculus strains. Two of the 3 main house mouse subspecies, do not have diversity in geographic sampling of wild derived inbred strains.
2-cell cryopreserved zygotes. Delivery in June. 
This is very exciting // we are very excitied to work with these mice -- since this is a (novel) source of genetic diversity to explore

2. I have mad significant progress on my macro -- ImageJ based macro
clarified the type of software -- shifting from fully automation to processing more user input -- this has made the program much more flexible and produces measurements very close to human made measurements.

3. progress lead me to apply for a NSF DDIG --- was not funded but -- it was a useful experience to outline logical and testable hypothesis for my data (will be applied to better understand the variation in recombination rates)

4. started to analyze the results from macro, (traits beyond CO number)



Heterochiasmy values are not known for many species. preliminary results suggest rapid evolution (and variation in direction and magnetidue). (to better understand why Hetreochiasmy evolve (the evolutionary forces acting causing heterochiasmy)
I have been quantiying meiorit recombiation rate estimates using immunoflorescance, to estimate sex-specific recombiantion rates from samples of house mouse populations (across varying evolutionary levels.) 
I have been quantifying meiotic recombination rate in single gametocyte cells from divergent strains of House Mouse. 
I have sucured 5 new inbred wild strains of mice, domesticus, cast, spicilegus.
the Final sampling panel will include X, X, X.


this range within several subspecies, across the house mouse species complex and two outgroup rodent species -- (will provide the most extensive survey of sex specific 

Last year gave talk
presented poster at GSA, won a poster award (third place graduate student).

applied for DDIG + trait correlations with CO number variation
 

#### New Questions
*What are correlations of CO number variation? (SC length, ect)?*
-tesable hypothesis for correlation of meiotic traits  // correlation of meiotic traits with CO number variation
        -SC
        -also meiotic 'mistakes'

*Can the Beam Film model of CO designation be applied to --questions concerning the evolutionary variation of recombination rates?*
-this is a new biolmechanical model to explain CO patterning (on a bivlent specific scale), It has not previously been applied to datasets // evolutionary based questions.
--the problem with beam film model is the number of parameters --- this presents a challenge that will require me to (explore the parametr space  ---  convergent states --  require testing the model to understand the (best estimate) of underlying changes in 
which have caused variation in evolutionary.

-variation in degree of sexual dimorphism

5. my goal for the summer is to outline manuscripts of my three chapters.
-get better at automating analyses and reports
-present a talk at evolution (on CO patterning variation)
