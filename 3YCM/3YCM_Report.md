### Research Progress
  <!--- Something about the gene patterns through time and coverage differences ?? -->  

#### New Questions
I continue to be interested in discerning the forces shaping wild bacterial populations, in order to understand how lineages diversify or remain cohesive. My work over the past year has generated new questions that address this research challenge.  

*Are there related sequence-discrete populations in TB and CB?  How closely related are they?  Do they share a common gene pool?* We now have GFM's from Crystal Bog (CB), which is of similar location and trophic status to Trout Bog (TB).  With these genomes, I will ask if there are related populations and how similar they are at the genome scale.  I will also investigate if these populations are really separated or if they share a common genepool.  I will compare the reference genomes and map reads from the opposite source.  From the acI SAGs we saw that reference genomes collected from different lakes do not recruit metagenomic reads with high ANI.

*Are all populations sequence-discrete?  What do non-seq-discrete groups look like? How does ANI structure of sequence-discrete populations compare between different lineages?* Most of the populations we have studied must be sequence-discrete in order to assemble into reference genomes from metagenomes.  One of my next goals is to investigate and compare population structures using references not assembled from communities.  Using both our SAGs and our metagenomes, as well as other marine and soil datasets of metagenomes paired with SAGs and sequenced fosmids, I will investigate population structure.  I am interested to see if I can find a population that does not fit the sequence-discrete pattern.  I have found some preliminary evidence that the LD12 and acTH1 lineages have different structures, in our freshwater datasets.  Along the same lines, I would like to quantify how the population structure, using ANI, is different for different lineages.
