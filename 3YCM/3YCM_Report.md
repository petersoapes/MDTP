### Research Progress
Over the last year I have been quantifying recombination rates in house mouse strains by quantifying MLH1 foci in spermatocytes and oocytes.  These completed results will be reported in the manuscript for my first chapter which will report the novel measures of heterochiasmy and treat the variation across house mouse samples within a polymorphism and divergence framework.  By quantifying recombination rates across the a panel of commercially available wild derived inbred strains raised in the same environment, the variation in the (strain averages of CO number) can be treated as stemming from wild genetic variation within an interbreeding population (within one of the three subspecies) or as variation across divergent populations (eg. Across subspecies ). By comparing these different levels of variation across males and females, this conceptual framework will allow us form make hypotheses for how evolutionary forces may be acting on the genetic architecture regulating recombination rates in oogenesis and spermatogenesis in house mouse. 

Already – preliminary results across (quantified) strains is revealing interesting patterns.
<for example> results suggest that mice (with genetic background from the Mmmusculus )  have elevated recombination rates (especially in males) whereas females (do not –vary (as much across the 3 main subspecies).
<impact…> (more variation //novel variation)

Part 2


#### New Questions
*Can (a/the biomechanical ) tension model for CO patterning be applied to --- make hypotheses (for the evolution of RR (and heterochiasmy in house mouse(mus musculus)?*
*Can the Beam Film model of CO designation be applied to --questions concerning the evolutionary variation of recombination rates?*
-this is a new biolmechanical model to explain CO patterning (on a bivlent specific scale), It has not previously been applied to datasets // evolutionary based questions.
--the problem with beam film model is the number of parameters --- this presents a challenge that will require me to (explore the parametr space  ---  convergent states --  require testing the model to understand the (best estimate) of underlying changes in 
which have caused variation in evolutionary.

*Selection causing M.m.musculus male pattern?*
*Can automated approaches be applied to generate bivalent level measures of CO patterning?*
