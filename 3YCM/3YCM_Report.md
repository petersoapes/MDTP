## Fourth Year Committee Report
April Peterson, Payseur Lab  
Meeting: April 28th, 2017 in BioTech 1234

### Research Progress
Heterochiasmy values are not known for many species. preliminary results suggest rapid evolution (and variation in direction and magnetidue). (to better understand why Hetreochiasmy evolve (the evolutionary forces acting causing heterochiasmy)
I have been quantiying meiorit recombiation rate estimates using immunoflorescance, to estimate sex-specific recombiantion rates from samples of house mouse populations (across varying evolutionary levels.) 
I have been quantifying meiotic recombination rate in single gametocyte cells from divergent strains of House Mouse. 
I have sucured 5 new inbred wild strains of mice, domesticus, cast, spicilegus.
the Final sampling panel will include X, X, X.


this range within several subspecies, across the house mouse species complex and two outgroup rodent species -- (will provide the most extensive survey of sex specific 

Last year gave talk
presented poster at GSA, won a poster award (third place graduate student).

applied for DDIG + trait correlations with CO number variation
 

#### New Questions
-what are correlations of CO number variation? (SC length, ect)?
