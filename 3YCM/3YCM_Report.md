## Professional Development
- Became a Software Carpentry Instructor in May 2015 after completing their instructor training. I have helped teach two workshops on campus and hope to instruct more this year.
- In fall 2014 I started the Molecular Microbial Ecology and Evolution(MoMiEE) support group. I plan and facilitate our monthly meetings, organize our webpage, and started a biweekly Python study group.  The goal of MoMiEE is to create a community of researchers using common methods to answer questions about microbial ecology or evolution.  (Something about keeping up with current methods/trends and helping each other to learn new skills?)
-  I started MoMiEE Python study group specifically to help the MoMiEE community (and others in MDTP) to improve our ability to write in Python, review other people's Python code, and become comfortable getting feedback on our own code.
