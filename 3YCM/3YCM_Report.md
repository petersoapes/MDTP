## Fourth Year Committee Report
April Peterson, Payseur Lab  
Meeting: April 28th, 2017 in BioTech 1234

### Research Progress
   Over the last year I have been estimating/quantifying recombination rates in (biological samples) by quantifying MLH1 foci in spermatocytes and oocytes.  This work (will be presented/reported/published) in/manuscript for my first chapter which will treat variation in heterochiasmy estimates across house mouse within a polymorphism and divergence framework.
(by (after) surveying/quantifying recombination rates across the a panel of (commercially) available wild derived inbred strains – the variation in sex-specific recombination rate estimates can be treated as variation from within a interbreeding population (within one of the three subspecies) or as variation across divergent / distinct populations (eg. Across subspecies ).
--(models/predictions for interpreting these levels of variation
This (applying this framework) will allow us to make hypotheses for how (modes of selection)/evolutionary forces may be acting differently on recombination rates in oogenesis and spermatogenesis. (causing SD/heterochiasmy)

Already – preliminary results across (quantified) strains is revealing interesting patterns.
<for example> results suggest that mice (with genetic background from the Mmmusculus )  have elevated recombination rates (especially in males) whereas females (do not –vary (as much across the 3 main subspecies).
<impact…> (more variation //novel variation)

#### New Questions
*Can (a/the biomechanical ) tension model for CO patterning be applied to --- make hypotheses (for the evolution of RR (and heterochiasmy in house mouse(mus musculus)?*
*Can the Beam Film model of CO designation be applied to --questions concerning the evolutionary variation of recombination rates?*
-this is a new biolmechanical model to explain CO patterning (on a bivlent specific scale), It has not previously been applied to datasets // evolutionary based questions.
--the problem with beam film model is the number of parameters --- this presents a challenge that will require me to (explore the parametr space  ---  convergent states --  require testing the model to understand the (best estimate) of underlying changes in 
which have caused variation in evolutionary.

*Selection causing M.m.musculus male pattern?*
*Can automated approaches be applied to generate bivalent level measures of CO patterning?*
